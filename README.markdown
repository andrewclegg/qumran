Qumran
======

Qumran is a Clojure wrapper around the [Rome syndication library](http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Javawsxml/Rome "Rome").

It simplifies access to the specific bits that I need :-) and provides a couple of utility functions.

Test it like so (requires Maven):

    mvn clojure:test

The tests, in src/test/clojure/com/nervechannel/, are the best guide to usage at the moment.

To package it and install it in your local Maven repo, do this:

    mvn install
